So, we pretend to create a PUB/SUB API in micro toolkit that can be used for this scenarios. This API will be agnostic to the implementations and several implementations can be hooked to perform this. Since this is project is using ZeroMQ heavily the first reference implementation will be done using ZeroMQ. Later other implementations can be added.
